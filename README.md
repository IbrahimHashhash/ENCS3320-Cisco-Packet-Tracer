# ENCS3320 - Computer Networks - Project #2: Network Design & Services

## Project Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for Project #2 of the ENCS3320 Computer Networks course at Birzeit University, Faculty of Engineering and Technology. The project focuses on designing and simulating a comprehensive "network of networks" using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

The primary goal is to enhance practical skills in network design, IP addressing (subnetting), routing (OSPF), and the configuration of essential network services such as Web, Email, DNS, and DHCP. It also covers wireless LAN setup and comprehensive network connectivity testing.

## Objectives

* **Design an IP Addressing Scheme:** Implement efficient subnetting for the entire network.
* **Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation:** Utilize Cisco Packet Tracer to build and simulate the defined network topology.
* **Network Service Configuration:** Configure and manage Web, Email, DNS, and DHCP servers.
* **Wireless LAN (WLAN) Setup:** Implement wireless network configurations.
* **IP Addressing & Connectivity:** Configure both static and DHCP IP addressing for various devices and ensure end-to-end connectivity.
* **Routing Implementation:** Configure and verify OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing across the network.
* **Testing & Verification:** Perform thorough testing to ensure all network services and connectivity function as expected (e.g., website access, email sending/receiving).

## Requirements

The project involves designing a network that includes:
* University Network (Main, CO, and multiple departments)
* Street Network
* Home Network
* Datacenter Network

Key configurations and services to be implemented:
* IP addressing and subnetting.
* OSPF routing.
* DHCP server.
* Web server.
* Email server (with domain and multiple accounts).
* DNS server.
* Wireless LAN configuration.
* Configuration of end devices (PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets) with appropriate IP settings (static/DHCP) and email clients.

## Deliverables

* **Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) File:** The complete network topology simulation.
* **Technical Report:** A comprehensive report detailing:
    * IP addressing scheme and subnetting.
    * Configuration steps for all devices and services.
    * Verification steps and results (connectivity, service functionality).
    * Analysis of the network design.
